# ShellCommander

## Project Description

[ShellCommander][repo-cmd] is a collection of Rust ports of scripts that I've wrote/found online. The goal is to port all of my scripts to create commands that can be run from any shell. Not just nushell or powershell.

Shell scripts can be found [here][repo-shell].

To install the Rust crate, run the following command:

```sh
cargo install cmd
```

To develop the crate make sure that the rust nightly toolchain is installed.

Provide usage instructions and examples here. For example, calling the crate from the command line:

### Roadmap

#### Commands

- [x] git **(6/6)**

    Contains all the functionality for managing a git repo and easily interacting with repos on disk.

  - [x] update
  - [x] get-dir
  - [x] set-dir
  - [x] fetch-ignore
  - [x] fetch-ignores
  - [x] list
- [ ] web-search **(2/2)**

    The message of the day that should be presented when a terminal boots up.

  - [ ] Message of the Day
- [ ] quotes **(0/4)**
  
    The quotes command will have four subcommands. These commands will allow for interacting with a local storage for quotes along with history of previous daily quotes. There will also be a link to a public API for providing quotes for in case the user wants to fetch a new quote.

    A potential providers: [Paper Quotes][api-paper-quotes], [Forbes Thoughts][api-forbes]

    > Note:
    > Forbes uses an API that provides for the quotes page. It's url is `http://www.forbes.com/forbesapi/thought/uri.json?enrich=true&query=1&relatedlimit=5`
