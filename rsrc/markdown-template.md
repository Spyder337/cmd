# Title

A good `README` description often takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:
    - Application's functionality
    - Technologies used and why
    - Development history and goals
  
## Installation

    Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the application installed, the environment set up, and running.

## Usage

    Include how to access/interact with credentials when demonstrating application usage. You should also include screenshots and descriptions of the structure and design principles in the application.

## Credits

    This is where acknowledgements go and links to other repos/papers go.

    Credit Links can be made in one of two ways:

    1. Link Literals

        ```markdown
        - [Awesome-Readme][https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme]
        - [FreeCodeCamp][https://www.makeareadme.com]
        - [Making A ReadMe][https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/]
        ```

    1. Link References

        ```markdown
        - [Awesome-Readme][1]
        - [FreeCodeCamp][2]
        - [Making A ReadMe][3]

        [1]: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme
        [2]: https://www.makeareadme.com
        [3]: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/
        ```

        Link references can make it easier to parse the references and rewrite documents without having to type out entire links.

## License

    This is optionally where a licesnse can go. Or one can be placed in a seperate file.
